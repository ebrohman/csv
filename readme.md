**Code Test Problem - CSV**

1.  Download a zip and navigate to the folder in terminal

2.  Run 'ruby csv\_example.rb' in terminal.  This code will take the 'numbers.csv' file, transform it by taking out leading zero's and sorting by header, and output a new file called 'new\_numbers.csv', or rewrite the existing file.
